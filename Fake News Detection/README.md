## Overview
This project focuses on the detection of fake news using advanced machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It involves preprocessing of textual data, feature extraction, and the application of clustering and deep learning models to accurately classify news articles as real or fake. The project uses a combination of Python libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, NLTK, and Keras, to implement the solution.

## Key Features

Data Integration: Combines datasets of news stances and bodies for a comprehensive analysis.

Text Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares text data through tokenization, stemming, and removal of stopwords.

Feature Extraction: Utilizes Bag of Words and TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into a machine-readable format.

Clustering with KMeans: Applies unsupervised learning to group similar text data, aiding in the analysis of news articles.

Deep Learning Classification: Employs a neural network model to classify news articles as real or fake with high accuracy.

Doc2Vec Embeddings: Generates document embeddings to capture the contextual nuances of textual data.
