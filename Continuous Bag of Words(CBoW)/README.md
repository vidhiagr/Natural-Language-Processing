# Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) Model Training
This project is designed to train a Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) model using PyTorch, aiming to predict a target word based on its surrounding context words. The CBOW model is a fundamental architecture in natural language processing (NLP) for learning word embeddings, which are vector representations of words capturing semantic similarities.

## Overview
The CBOW model implemented in this project takes context words as input and predicts the target word. It leverages PyTorch for model definition and training, employing an embedding layer to learn word representations and a linear layer for prediction. The project includes comprehensive steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the learned embeddings.
